<h1>Car Data Predict</h1>
<hr><p>This project involves training a machine learning model with a car dataset to predict the price and other details of a car when queried.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>This project uses machine learning to predict car prices and other details based on a given dataset. By training a model on various car attributes such as make, model, year, and features, the system can provide accurate information, including price estimates, when a user queries about a specific car. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in real-world data prediction tasks.</li>
